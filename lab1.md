##c.2 List at least two suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
1. Do not prepare a really vague/general question to ask for help. Cut it in detailed questions. It would be easy to find out answers on the Internet and would be easier for others to answer it. Because the detailed problems may happen in lot of big projects and many people have experienced it already. 
2. Think before asking a question. Sometimes we just stuck on some points and cannot go out of the loop. If leaving it alone for a while, you will be enlightened suddenly some time.
3. Be grateful. It is not others responsibility to answer your questions. They help you because they are helpful, you cannot blame others if they do not help you.

##c.3 Write a short paragraph ( 8 to 10 sentences) of what you got out of reading that chapter.
In this chapter, it talked about a student in RPI was prosecuted because he improved Windows file sharing and a search engine without permission. I think it is helpful to learn something about copyright before starting doing something using a licensed software/program. I do not know if Windows file share or search engine is open source or not, but before starting modifying them, it is necessary to acknowledge the license information before using. In this case, the student was utilizing it for non-profit reason and he did not saying the product belonged to him. Maybe the reason of getting prosecuted was that he did not announce the copyrights initially before sharing it other students. If we need to do something relating to taking other products, we need to look into the copyrights thing carefully to avoid such thing happen. And in addition, we need to understand the identity of the program we are going to use as well.
