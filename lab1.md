##c.2 
1. Do not prepare a really vague/general question to ask for help. Cut it in detailed questions. It would be easy to find out answers on the Internet and would be easier for others to answer it. Because the detailed problems may happen in lot of big projects and many people have experienced it already. 
2. Think before asking a question. Sometimes we just stuck on some points and cannot go out of the loop. If leaving it alone for a while, you will be enlightened suddenly some time.
3. Be grateful. It is not others responsibility to answer your questions. They help you because they are helpful, you cannot blame others if they do not help you.
