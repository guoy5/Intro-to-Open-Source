###2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
When putting codes/programs online, the person will met many problems. By choosing permissive license or copyleft license, the developer can limit the project openess, how should others share the projects. Furthermore, the developers might met the problems about the patent and commercial use. It does not only helps the original developers to define their more clearly so that when someone breaks the rule they will notice, but also available for others who wants to use the program so that they know what they can do and what they cannot. 


###3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
As long as the project does not have a license, the users of the projects would have many indeterminancy to use the projects. The users will not have the ability to know whether they can share the projects to others, whether they can use it commercially and if they can use the patent in this projects. So using a project that does not have an explicit license is unsafe. 

###4. claims on Why the Web beat Gopher
Personally I agree with the author. Open Source Software does not only serve for those users. The inspiration of a person or a single group sometimes is not enough for making critical progress. Though the technique for Gopher was indeed not so up-to-date at that time, the failure to sharing its complete concepts/characteristics to the users/potential users was one of the reason. 

###5. .NET Core uses MIT license
.NET is a language for developing applications and games on Windows, Mac and Linux. The users who use it might need some customisation if they want to their own programs. And also, the permission for commercial use is also needed, as the that is how the developing tool survives. In addition, Microsoft does not responsible for how people using this app. MIT license includes the permission of commercial use, distribution, modification and private use. It is certainly great for a developing app.
