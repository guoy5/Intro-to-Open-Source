###2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
When putting codes/programs online, the person will met many problems. By choosing permissive license or copyleft license, the developer can limit the project openess, how should others share the projects. Furthermore, the developers might met the problems about the patent and commercial use. It does not only helps the original developers to define their more clearly so that when someone breaks the rule they will notice, but also available for others who wants to use the program so that they know what they can do and what they cannot. 


###3. Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
As long as the project does not have a license, the users of the projects would have many indeterminancy to use the projects. The users will not have the ability to know whether they can share the projects to others, whether they can use it commercially and if they can use the patent in this projects. So using a project that does not have an explicit license is unsafe.
